            Welcome to Heritage Institute of Technology, Kolkata
           <br> 
            As you embark on your journey here, do remember that college education is not entirely academic in nature. It extends
            beyond the classrooms, laboratories and workshops, to campus action groups, seminars, meetings, cultural and social
            activities and sporting events.
            <br>
            I hope that you will be proud of being a member of the Heritage family. Members of faculty of the Institute are known
            for their academic achievements, teaching abilities and commitment.
            <br>
            You will be challenged to unlock your potential and hone your strength and abilities. You will gain the confidence to
            push yourself towards new horizons. We will judge our success as an institution by how well you succeed in realising
            your potential as a student and in your professional career later.
            <br>
            Now that you have chosen Heritage Institute of Technology, Kolkata, I encourage you to explore all that the institution
            has to offer.

           <p> I am delighted to welcome you to the Heritage Institute of Technology, Kolkata (HIT-K), a distinguished institute for
            engineering education in this part of the world.</p>
            
           <p> Right from the inception, HIT-K has been committed to provide quality engineering education to its students at both
            undergraduate and postgraduate levels. Innovation has been one of the key factors in HIT-K and we constantly try to
            prepare our students as responsible and innovative global citizens having a firm grounding in their respective
            disciplines.</p>
            
           <p> It may be highlighted that all eligible B.Tech. Programmes of the Institute are accredited by the National Board of
            Accreditation (NBA). The Institute was also one of the 25 private unaided engineering institutions across the country
            selected for Technical Education Quality Improvement Programme (TEQIP), Phase II, a World Bank funded initiative of the
            MHRD, Government of India, the primary objective of which was to enhance the quality of teaching and learning, and
            thereby, expanding the employability space of the graduating students. Based on these achievements, the Institute has
            been able to secure Autonomous Status from the University Grants Commission (UGC), New Delhi with effect from the
            Academic Year 2014-15.</p>
            
            <p>The HIT-K has all along encouraged its faculty and students to engage in cutting-edge research and present their
            findings in National and International Conferences and to publish in refereed National and International Journals. In
            order to give students exposure to the global engineering ethos at an early age, the HIT-K has made standing
            arrangements and signed MOUs with a number of premier US and UK universities for academic and educational collaboration,
            including summer research internships.</p>
            
           <p> HIT-K is fortunate to have a team of academically – enlightened and dedicated members of faculty, trained in premier
            universities and institutions in the country and abroad, who are at the forefront of their professional activities. This
            prospectus includes information on the distinctions of the HIT – K in general, in the field of academics and highlights
            some achievements of the institute in Research and Development (R & D) and in providing consultancy to the industry and
            to the government.</p>

            cover, please do not hesitate to contact us personally. We will be pleased to help you with answers to your queries.</p>
            
            <p> I look forward to meeting you in person and take this opportunity to wish you all the best for your higher studies at
